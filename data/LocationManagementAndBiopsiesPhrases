The duodenal stricture is non-peristaltic and exhibits limited mobility upon insufflation.
The stricture appears to be extraluminal in nature, with no evidence of intraluminal obstruction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_DuodenumNodularDescriptors
At the first part of the duodenum, there are multiple nodules, each measuring 0.5-1 cm in diameter.
These nodules have a polypoid appearance with a smooth surface, suggestive of hamartomatous polyps.
The nodules are pink in color, with no signs of bleeding or ulceration.
There are multiple Paris type 0-I nodules distributed throughout the duodenal bulb.
On closer inspection, these nodules have a velvety surface and are non-tender to touch.
There is a single Paris type 0-IIa nodule located in the second part of the duodenum, measuring 0.8 cm in diameter.
The nodule has a smooth, slightly elevated surface and appears to be covered with a layer of mucus.
Multiple nodules are present in the third part of the duodenum, with irregular shapes and sizes.
The nodules have a granular and erythematous appearance and are classified as Paris type 0-IIb.
The duodenal nodules are consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoid hyperplasia, without any signs of malignancy.
A single nodule is present in the fourth part of the duodenum, measuring 1.2 cm in diameter and classified as Paris type 0-IIa.
The nodule has a smooth, slightly raised surface, and appears to be non-bleeding and non-tender.
Multiple nodules are seen in the periampullary region, with a papillary or sessile appearance.
These nodules are pink, with a smooth surface, and have a Paris classification of 0-IIa or 0-IIb.
There is a single 0-IIc Paris type nodule present in the fourth part of the duodenum, measuring 1.5 cm in diameter.
The nodule has a slightly elevated, irregular surface, and is covered with a layer of mucus.
Multiple small nodules measuring up to 0.5 cm in diameter are seen in the second and third part of the duodenum.
The nodules have a polypoid appearance with smooth surfaces, and are classified as Paris type 0-I.
The duodenal nodules appear consistent with a diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease, without any signs of complications.
Multiple nodules are present throughout the duodenum, with a range of Paris classifications, suggesting a multifocal disease process.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_PolypBiopsies
The polyp was visualized and biopsied during upper endoscopy.
Under endoscopic visualization, the polyp was removed using EMR.
ESD was performed to remove the polyp after lifting it with saline injection.
The polyp was marked with a tattoo to aid in future surveillance endoscopy.
Due to its large size, the polyp was not able to be resected during the current endoscopic session.
The polyp did not lift on saline injection and was therefore not amenable to endoscopic resection.
Using a snare, the polyp was excised and retrieved for pathologic analysis.
Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed to remove the polyp in its entirety.
The base of the polyp was cauterized with an argon plasma coagulator to prevent bleeding.
The polyp was grasped with a snare and cut with a hot biopsy forceps for removal.
The polyp was removed with a combination of snare and forceps, and hemostasis was achieved with an endoscopic clip.
The base of the polyp was fulgurated with an electrocautery device to prevent future bleeding or regrowth.
The polyp was removed with minimal thermal injury to surrounding tissue using a cold snare technique.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_UlcerBiopsies
The ulcer was biopsied x8 for further analysis.
Difficulty was encountered during biopsy as the tissue of the lesion appeared hard and challenging to obtain samples from.
Following the biopsy of the lesion, there was bleeding, which was promptly managed.
A biopsy of the lesion was taken using a forceps under direct endoscopic visualization.
The lesion was suspicious, and multiple biopsies were taken to ensure adequate tissue sampling.
Biopsies of the lesion were taken from both the edges and the center to obtain a representative sample.
During biopsy, it was noted that the lesion had a friable surface and bled easily.
Multiple biopsies were taken of the lesion to ensure adequate sampling, given its irregular shape.
Biopsy samples of the lesion were obtained using a cold snare to minimize the risk of thermal injury.
The biopsy was performed using a needle biopsy forceps, with the tissue samples sent for pathological analysis.
During biopsy, the lesion was noted to be firm and required multiple passes to obtain a diagnostic sample.
After taking a biopsy of the lesion, hemostasis was achieved with hemoclips to control any bleeding.
The lesion was biopsied using a standard forceps.
