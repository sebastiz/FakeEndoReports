-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_StomachPolypDescriptors
The gastric polyp looks fundic.
The gastric polyp looks malignant.
The gastric polyp looks adenomatous.
The gastric polyp looks hyperplastic.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_StomachUlcerDescriptors
The gastric ulcer looks malignant.
The ulceration is severe and there are multiple areas affected.
The ulceration is likely NSAID related.
Ulceration is likely Helicobacter pylori related.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_StomachStrictureDescriptors
The stricture is relative to the stomach body.
The is the impression of extrinsic compression but in fact the stricture is likely mucosal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_StomachInflammationDescriptors
The inflammatory changes are likely to be Helicobacter related.
Portal hypertensive gastropathy is likely responsible for the inflammatory changes.
The inflammation is in an odd distribution.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_StomachNoduleDescriptors
The nodular changes may represent early fundic gland polyps.
The nodules have an abnormal pit pattern and may represent an early gastric cancer.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_OesophagealPolypDescriptors
The regularity of the nodular areas suggests that they are regenerative
oesophagus at (cm).
The polypoid lesion looks postinflammatory.
The stalked nature of the polyp makes it amenable to a polypectomy rather than EMR.
The lesion is classifiable as Paris IIa.
This is a Paris IIa/c lesion.
This is a Paris IIb lesion.
Closer examination of the lesion is necessary +/- EUS.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_OesophagealUlcerDescriptors
The ulceration was semi circumferential.
The ulceration is suspicious for an adenocarcinoma.
The ulceration is likely to be a refulx oesophagitis.
The ulceration and its position is suggestive of a pill oesophagitis.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_OesophagealStrictureDescriptors
The stricture is likely malignant.
This is suggestive of eosinophillic oesophagitis.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_OesophagealInflammationDescriptors
The oesophageal inflammation is non-descript.
The inflammation may be acid reflux related.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_OesophagealNodularDescriptors
Regenerative change most likely explains the nodular changes.
The nodular area is a Paris IIa/c lesion.
This is a Paris IIb lesion.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_DuodenumPolypDescriptors
The duodenal lesion looks like an adenoma.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_DuodenumUlcerDescriptors
The ulcer is likely Helicobacter related.
THe ulcer looks like an invasive lesion.
THe distribution of ulceration suggests a lymphomatous lesion.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_DuodenumStrictureDescriptors
The duodenal stricture is likely related to previous ulceration
The stricture may need stenting eventually.
Likely Crohn's related stricturing
The stricture feels fibrotic
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_DuodenumInflammationDescriptors
The duodenitis is likely to heal with PPI therapy.
The duodenitis is likely to heal spontaneously.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_DuodenumNodularDescriptors
The nodularity in the duodenum is likely a healing duodenitis.
The nodularity is associated with scalloping and suggests a coeliac disease.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_PolypBiopsies
The polyp was biopsied.
The polyp was resected by EMR.
The polyp was resected by ESD.
The polyp was tatooed.
The polyp was too large to resect.
The polyp did not lift on injection with normal saline and was therefore not resected
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_UlcerBiopsies
The ulcer was biopsied x8.
The ulcer will be rebiopsied at the next endoscopy.
Biopsies were difficult to take as hard tissue.
Bleeding on biopsy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_StrictureBiopsies
The stricture was biopsied x8.
The stricture will be rebiopsied at the next endoscopy.
Biopsies were difficult to take as hard tissue.
Bleeding on biopsy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_InflammationBiopsies
The inflammation was biopsied x8.
The inflammation will be rebiopsied at the next endoscopy.
Biopsies were difficult to take as hard tissue.
Bleeding on biopsy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------FD_NoduleBiopsies
The nodular area was biopsied x8.
The nodule will be rebiopsied at the next endoscopy.
Biopsies were difficult to take as hard tissue.
Bleeding on biopsy.
