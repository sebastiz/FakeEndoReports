-----------------------------------------------------------------Macroscopic_Description
This is specialised gastric mucosa
This is non-specialised gastric mucosa
These biopsies show specialised gastric mucosa
These biopsies show non-specialised gastric mucosa
These are biopsies of specialised gastric-type mucosa
These are biopsies of specialised and non-specialised (antral-type) gastric mucosa
These are biopsies of specialised (fundic/body type) gastric mucosa
These are biopsies of non-specialised gastric-type mucosa
These are biopsies of non-specialised (antral-type) gastric mucosa
These are biopsies of columnar mucosa
The biopsy shows specialised gastric mucosa
The biopsy shows a superficial fragment of non-specialised gastric mucosa
The background columnar mucosa shows intestinal metaplasia
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_Inflammation
There are a few aggregates of epithelioid macrophages surrounding deeper glnads amounting to a microgranulomas
This is associated with a patchy increase in lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria
The biopsies show oedema mild chronic formation and patchy intestinal metaplasia
These appearances can be seen adjacent to an ulcer
These appearances can be seen adjacent to an erosion/ulcer
Thereare reactive changes with foveolar hyperplasia and muscularisation of the lamina propria
There are dilated glands lined by bland glandular epithelial cells
One biopsy on the strip show congestion and reactive cytological atypia
Some biopsies show non-specialised gastric mucosa with foveolar hyperplasia and dilatation
Some biopsies consist of non-specialised and specialised gastric-type mucosa and show a mild chronic inactive gastritis with a few vertical smooth muscle fibres in the lamina propria and a suggestion of foveolar hyperplasia
The non-polypoid piece of tissue consists of non-specialised gastric-type mucosa and submucosa showing atrophy and intestinal metaplasia
The lamina propria is oedematous and contains prominent smooth muscle fibres
The lamina propria has a moderate chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate
Small numbers of Helicobacter-like organisms (HLOs) are present
There is a significant increase in chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria and acute inflammation
One biopsy shows densely inflamed granulation tissue and ulcer slough only
Occasional cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusions are identified within the granulation tissue confirmed by CMV immunostaining and are judged likely to be pathogenic
There is muscularisation of the lamina propria mild chronic inflammation and surface erosion
There is mild atrophy (please note that the site of the biopsies is not stated on the request form and if the biopsies were taken from the gastric body autoimmune gastritis should be considered)
In the ulcer base the lamina propria shows a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate of neutrophils histiocytes lymphocytes and eosinophils
There is foveolar hyperplasia and fibromuscularisation of the lamina propria
Focal gastric surface foveolar metaplasia is noted (Helicobacter stain pending)
There is focal gastric surface foveolar metaplasia and focal associated mild increase in chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria
There is extensive surface erosion with underlying acute and chronic inflammation
There is acute inflammatory exudate on the cellulose strip the significance of which is uncertain
There is a significant increase in intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) upto 45 lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes
There is a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate of neutrophils lymphocytes histiocytes plasma cells and eosinophils in the lamina propria but intraepithelial eosinophils are not increased
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_General
There are also areas that are poorly orientated and cross cut
There are a few smooth muscle fibres within the lamina propria
The are abnormalities in the underlying mucosa
Several dilated glands are seen
Paneth cells are seen
Only focal cystic dilation of glands is seen
There is insufficient material to assess for a sub-epithelial lesion
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_Dysplasia
The surface is largely denuded however where identified the crypts show nuclear changes amounting to low grade dysplasia which focally extends to the surface epitelium
The polypoid pieces consist of non-specialised gastric-type mucosa and submucosa with focal intestinal metaplasia and consisting of parts of a tubular adenoma with predominantly moderate (low grade) dysplasia
One of the biopsies is suboptimally orientated with denuded surface epithelium however the crypts show crowding and irregular branching
Irregular gland profiles are seen here
There is foveolar hyperplasia but dilated fundic glands are seen
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion2
These specimens have been sent for DNA ploidy
The columnar mucosa is composed of cardia type gastric mucosa
Repeat biopsy is advised
Please correlate with endoscopic and radiological findings
Modified giemsa stain for Helicobacter-like organisms (HLOs) has been requested and a supplementary report will be issued
Infective (mycobacterial fungal) and non-infective (Crohn's disease sarcoidosis and drugs) causes need to be excluded clinically
I noted the worrying clinical features repeat biopsy is advised if clinical indicated
HER2 immunohistochemistry has been requested and a supplementary report will be issued
Assessment is difficult due to the poor orientation
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_Polyp
The features would be in keeping with the endoscopic suggestion of fundic gland polyps
The features are those of a fundic gland polyp
The features are of a hyperplastic polyp
The features are consistent with cystic fundic (fundic gland) polyps
The features are consistent with a hyperplastic polyp
The appearances are of a hyperplastic polyp
The appearances are most in keeping with a hyperplastic polyp
The appearances are in keeping with an inflammatory or hyperplastic polyp
The appearances are consistent with hyperplastic polyps
The appearances are consistent with fundic gland polyps
The appearances are consistent with a hyperplastic polyp
This is a hyperplastic polyp
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_Inflammation
The features would be consistent with a mild reactive/chemical gastritis
The features raise the possibility of a mild reactive/ chemical gastritis
The features are those of active chronic inflammation with granuloma formation
The features are of mild chronic inflammation
The features are of acute inflammation and chronic inflammation
The features are in keeping with a reactive/chemical gastritis
The appearances are those of Helicobacter associated chronic active gastritis
The appearances are those of erosive gastritis
The appearances are of achronic active Helicobacter assocated gastritis
The appearances are of a reactive/chemical gastritis
The appearances are in keeping with a reactive/chemical gastritis
The appearances are consistent with a reactive gastropathy
If these biopsies are definitely from the gastric body the absence of specialised glands would be consistent with atrophy
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_Cancer
The features are those of intramucosal adenocarcinoma at-least on these sections examined and most likely represent superificial biopsies of a poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma
