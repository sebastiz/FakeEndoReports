-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion
As the polyp is said to be from the duodenum the appearances are those of gastric metaplasia
As this is focal I would think there is a possibility it is just a physiologic increase over a lymphoid aggregate that we don't see in these sections
The aetiology of the mild chronic duodenitis is not apparent histologically
The features are consistent with gastric heterotopia
This morphology indicates inflammatory bowel disease Crohn 's disease sub-type
You can get raised IELs in Helicobacter infection and NSAID use amongst other things
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_CD
In the clinical context the features are consistent with coeliac disease
In the clinical context the features are of suggestive of refractory coeliac disease
The appearances are consistent with coeliac disease in the appropriate clinical setting
The appearances are consistent with the known history of coeliac disease Marsh score 3a in this biopsy material
The appearances of raised intra-epithelial lymphocytes can be seen in coeliac disease infection and in drug use
The cause of the mild chronic duodenitis is not apparent histologically and the features are not diagnostic of coeliac disease
The features are consistent with coeliac disease
The features are those of intraepithelial lymphocytosis
The features are typical of coeliac disease (Marsh classification 3b)
The features raise the possibility of coeliac disease (Marsh classification 3a) and serology is advised
The histological appearances are consistent with coeliac disease
The histological changes are non-specific but raise the possibility of coeliac disease
There is a mild chronic duodenitis but the features are not diagnostic of coeliac disease
These features are non-specific however the differential diagnosis would include drug aetiology resolving infection and first presentation of IBD
This is in agreement with the positive coeliac serology finding
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_Normal
Biopsies consist of small bowel mucosa and are within normal histological limits
The are no abnormalities in the underlying mucosa
The duodenal biopsies are within normal histological limits
The features are within normal limits
The small bowel fragments are within normal limits
The villous architecture is normal
There is crosscutting artefact but no villous atrophy or significant inflammation is seen
There is no evidence of coeliac disease
There is no evidence of coeliac disease in these biopsies
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion2
Clinical correlation is advised
Coeliac serology correlation is advised
Correlation with Coeliac serology is required
Deeper tissue levels will be cut and examined and a supplementary reportadded in due course
I will but further sections for H&E and request repeat immunostaining to see if more material cuts in
Immunohistochemistry for IEL immunophenotyping is awaited and a supplementary report will be issued
PCRfor TCR has been requested
Please correlate clinically and with serology
Please correlate with clinical findings
Special stains for organisms are pending for completeness
The biopsy material is scanty and one is rather superficial
The immunostains also are not adequate for assessment
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description
Polypoid villiform and glandular architecture with the epithelium showing features of low grade dysplasia (nuclear hyperchromasia elongation and stratification)
Tubular and villous architecture and show diffuse low grade glandular dysplasia characterised by nuclear hyperchromasia elongation and stratification
Villi lined by a mixture of gastric-type and intestinal-type epithelium with an underlying moderate chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lamina propria
Description-CD3
On immunohistochemistry these express CD3 owever under 50% show loss of CD8 expression
On immunostaining there are 38 CD3 positive intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) per 100 enterocytes (similar to H&E) and 26 IELs per 100 enterocytes express CD8 hence there is a 32% loss of CD8 expression in the IELs which would be in keeping with refractory Coeliac disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_IELs
Intraepithelial lymphocytes are increased (upto 55 lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells on CD3 immunohistochemistry)
Intraepithelial lymphocytosis (x lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes on the H& E stain)
Preserved villous architecture and no increase in intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs)
There is a diffuse mild increase in chronic inflammation along with a patchy increase in intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) within the proximal biopsies
There is preserved villous architecture (for D1) but a focal mild increase in intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) up to 30 per 100 enterocytes along with a mild increase in lamina propria chronic inflammatory cells
These are fragments of small bowel mucsao which include Brunner's glands and show preserved crypt-villous architecture and a mild increase oin intraepithelial lymphocytosis (40 lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes as counted on the CD3 immunostain)
This biopsy of duodenal mucosa and submucosa (including Brunners glands) shows patchy gastric metaplasia and a borderline increase inintra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) upto 29 per 100 enterocytes
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_Inflammation
Chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the lamina propria
The lamina propria contains a prominent plasma cell infiltrate
The lamina propria has a moderate chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate
There is a moderate increase in lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria
This is associated with a patchy increase in lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria
This is non-specialised gastric mucosa with mild acute and chronic inflammation of an expanded oedematous lamina propria along with irregularly shaped glands lined by foveolar epithelium
