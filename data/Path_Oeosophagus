-----------------------------------------------------------------Macroscopic_Description
These are biopsies of oesophageal-type squamous mucosa
These are biopsies of stratified squamous non-keratinising epithelium
The sections show squamo-columnar mucosa
The biopsies show squamous epithelium
The biopsies are of oesophageal squamous mucosa
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_List
focal ulceration with granulation tissue
eosinophilia
eosinophil microabscesses are seen
eosinophil infiltrate
eosinophilic microabscesses
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_Inflammation
The surface epithelium shows marked basal cell hyperplasia
The surface epithelium shows basal cell hyperplasia and lamina propria papillae elongation
The lamina propria shows fibrosis and mixed chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate
There is muscularisation of the lamina propria and mild chronic inflammation
In the ulcer base the lamina propria shows a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate of neutrophils histiocytes lymphocytes and eosinophils
There is basal hyperplasia and elongation of the lamina papillae
Although ulceration or significant acute inflammation is seen in these biopsies separate fragments of pus and ulcer slough are noted
Also included are biopsies of oesophageal-type squamous mucosa with ulceration basal atypia amounting to reactive changes and acute inflammation
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_EoE
The count is estimated at x eosinophils per HPF
The biopsies from 36 cm show an intra-epithelial eosinophilic count of x per HPF
There is a patchy increase in intraepithelial eosinophils which does not follow a proximal  -distal gradient
There is a mild intra-epithelial infiltrate of lymphocytes histiocytes and very occasional eosinophils (counted at up to 2 per high-power field)
a prominent eosinophil infiltrate present in all biopsies predominantly within the superficial layers
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_Dysplasia
submucosal invasion or lymphovascular invasion is seen
desmoplastic reaction or stromal invasion is seen
The larger piece shows focal high grade epithelial dysplasia in surface and crypt epithelium with crypt crowding and increased mitotic activity
vascular invasion is seen in these slides
The surface is largely denuded however where identified the crypts show nuclear changes amounting to low grade dysplasia which focally extends to the surface epitelium
The nuclear polarity is preserved
The glandular cells show hyperchromatic enlarged nuclei and an increase in mitoses
The glandular cells show enlarge nuclei with minimal cytoplasm
The crypts and surface epithelium show reactive nuclear changes with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli
Necrosis is seen in some of the gland lumens
There is invasion of the muscularis mucosa or submucosa
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion2
These specimens have been sent for DNA ploidy
The appearances remain the same compared to the previous biopsies
Repeat biopsies are advised if clinically indicated
Re-biopsy is advised if clinically indicated
Please correlate with endoscopic and radiological findings
Modified giemsa stain for Helicobacter-like organisms (HLOs) has been requested and a supplementary report will be issued
HER2 immunohistochemistry has been requested and a supplementary report will be issued
Due to the lack of submucosal tissue it is not possible to assess for buried glands
DPAS staining forfungi is negative
DNA ploidy testing has been requested
Diastase Periodic Acid Schiff (DPAS) stain for fungi has been requested and a supplementary report will be issued
Clinical correlation is advised
Clinical and endoscopic correlation is advised
A special stain for Helicobacter-like organisms (HLOs) will be performed and a supplementary report will be issued
A Helicobacter stain is pending
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_Normal
The biopsies are within normal histological limits
These biopsies of oesophageal-type squamous epithelium are within normal histological limits
These are biopsies of squamous epithelium which are within normal histological limits
The oesophageal biopsies show squamous epithelium within normal histological limits
The biopsies of lower and upper oesophageal squamous mucosa are within normal histological limits
The biopsies from all sites show squamous epithelium within normal histological limits
These biopsies consist of stratified squamous non-keratinising epithelium and are within normal histological limits
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_Inflammation
The features would be consistent with reflux oesophagitis
The features are of mild chronic inflammation
The features are of acute inflammation and chronic inflammation
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_EoE
The intra-epithelial eosinophilia in the mid oesophageal biopsies is similar to that of the mid oesophageal biopsies of the latest previous biopsies
The histological changes support the clinical impression of eosinophilic oesophagitis
The features are consistent with eosinophilic oesophagitis with a reduced eosinophil count compared to the previous sample
The appearances favour eosinophilic oesophagitis over reflux oesophagitis
The appearances are those of intraepithelial eosinophilia
The appearances are of eosinophilic oesophagitis
The appearances are in keeping with eosinophilic oesophagitis
The appearances are consistent with eosinophilic oesophagitis
features suggestive of eosinophilic oesophagitis
features of eosinophilic oesophagitis
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_Dysplasia
The features are those of high grade glandular dysplasia
The features are judged to be indefinite for dysplasia
