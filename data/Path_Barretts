-----------------------------------------------------------------Macroscopic_Description
This biopsy shows squamocolumnar mucosa
These biopsies show specialised gastric mucosa
These biopsies show squamo-columnar mucosa
These are biopsies of non-specialised (antral-type) gastric mucosa
These biopsies show columnar mucosa
The smallest piece consists of oesophageal squamo-columnar mucosa and submucosa including submucosal glands.
The sections show oesophageal-type squamous mucosa
The sections show glandular mucosa with an oesophageal duct
The biopsies consists of columnar mucosa and submucosa with a thickened and splayed muscularis mucosae
These are biopsies consist of stratified squamous non-keratinising epithelium
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_OAC
The intramucosal adenocarcinoma invades superficially into muscularis mucosae fibres
The intramucosal adenocarcinoma extends to the lateral resection margin and is less than 1 mm from the deep resection margin (block A8)
submucosal invasion or lymphovascular invasion is seen
lymphovascular invasion is seen and the lesion is 2mm from the submucosal margin
invasive malignancy is seen in these sections examined
invasive malignancy is seen and Helicobacter-like organisms (HLOs) are identified
invasive malignancy is seen
invasive adenocarcinoma is identified
In all specimens there are foci with dilated atypical glands containing necrotic debris which are regarded as amounting tointramucosal adenocarcinoma
Glandular crowding with back-to-back arrangement is identified amounting to intramucosal adenocarcinoma
desmoplastic reaction or stromal invasion is seen

-----------------------------------------------------------------Description_D
The high grade dysplasia is present in the end sections
The glandular cells show hyperchromatic enlarged nuclei and an increase in mitoses
The glandular cells show enlarge nuclei with minimal cytoplasm
The glands show focal cribiform patterns
The features are those of high grade glandular dysplasia
The features are judged to be indefinite for dysplasia
On immunohistochemistry for p53 these glands show diffuse strong nuclear positivity
Necrosis is seen in some of the gland lumens
In areas the metaplastic crypts have large pleomorphic and mitotically active nuclei but the little surface epithelium present appears to mature
In addition the larger piece shows focal high grade epithelial dysplasia in surface and crypt epithelium with crypt crowding and increased mitotic activity
In addition in the largest biopsy there are crowded glands lined by cells with mitotically active large open nuclei with prominent nucleoli
Focally in areas that are not inflamed the crypts show marked nucleated pleomorphism with mitoses and the overlying epithelium shows nuclear elongation and stratification judged to be indefinite for dysplasia
Dysplasia extends to the lateral mucosal margins
patchy glandular epithelial atypia showing nuclear stratification increased mitotic activity and loss of maturation towards the surface epithelium
extensive intestinal metaplasia as well as areas of high grade glandular dysplasia where the nuclei are large and open with prominent nucleoli
extensive intestinal metaplasia and focally the crypts show similarfeatures to those identified in the largest piece judged to be indefinite for dysplasia
extensive high grade dysplasia on the background of barrett 's oesophagus with patchy intestinal metaplasia
-----------------------------------------------------------------Description
These are lined by severely atypical cells with oval to round hyperchromatic nuclei amounting to high grade dysplasia
There are mild reactive epithelial changes
The surface is largely denuded however where identified the crypts show nuclear changes amounting to low grade dysplasia which focally extends to the surface epitelium
The specimen consists of fragments of squamo-columnar mucosa showing moderate chronic inflammation
The sections show biopsies of ulcerated squamo-columnar mucosa with patchy intestinal metaplasia
The nuclear polarity is preserved
The columnar mucosa is composed of cardia type gastric mucosa
The biopsies from 31cm show columnar mucosa with extensive intestinal metaplasia and mild chronic inflammation
The biopsies from 29cm show squamocolumnar and columnar mucosa with extensive intestinal metaplasia and mild chronic inflammation
The background columnar mucosa shows intestinal metaplasia
Specialised gastric type mucosa with mild chronic inflammation and oedema
intestinal metaplasia is seen
Intestinal metaplasia is also noted
In places the glands extend into superficial muscularis mucosae
Due to the lack of submucosal tissue it is not possible to assess for buried glands
Due to lack of lamina propria it is not possible to assess for buried glands
Although ulceration or significant acute inflammation is seen in these biopsies separate fragments of pus and ulcer slough are noted
significant inflammation
focal gastric surface foveolar metaplasia and focal associated mild increasein chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria

This case has been shown to Dr U consultant gastrointestinal pathologist who agrees with this diagnosis
This case has been seen by Dr H
This case has been seen by Dr F
This case has been reviewed by Dr G (Consultant Histopathologist) who agrees with this diagnosis
This case has been reviewed by Dr B (Consultant Histopathologist) who agrees with the diagnosis
These specimens have been sent for DNA ploidy
Repeat biopsies are advised if clinically indicated
Modified giemsa stain for Helicobacter-like organisms (HLOs) has been requested and a supplementary report will be issued
DNA ploidy testing has been requested
Dr D a second GSTT GI consultant histopathologist who is in agreement with this diagnosis
Clinical correlation is advised
Dr C, a second GSTT GI consultant histopathologist who is in agreement with this diagnosis
A special stain for Helicobacter-like organisms (HLOs) will be performed and a supplementary report will be issued
A Helicobacter stain is pending
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_OAC
The features are of at least high grade glandular dysplasia and are judged to amount to intramucosal adenocarcinoma
---------------Conclusion_NonSpecBarr
The histological changes are non-specific but raise the possibility of Barrett 's oesophagus
The appearances are those of columnar lined oesophagus
The appearances are consistent with Barrett's oesophagus
In the context of the biopsies being taken within the tubular oesophagus and in the presence of endoscopically visible Barrett 's oesophagus then these are the featuresof Barrett 's oesophagus with gastric metaplasia
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_Inflamm
The features are of mild chronic inflammation
The features are consistent with 'Barrett 's oesophagus with intestinal metaplasia'
If the biopsies are from the tubular oesophagus the appearances are consistent with'Barrett's oesophagus with intestinal metaplasia'
The features are consistent with 'Barrett 's oesophagus with gastric metaplasia only'
-----------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion_D
The appearances are consistent with low grade dysplasia arising in a background of Barrett 's oesophagus
The appearances are consistent with high grade glandular epithelial dysplasia arising in a background of Barrett's oesophagus
