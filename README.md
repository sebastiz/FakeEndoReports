# FakeEndoReports

The idea of this project is to create synthesised Endoscopic reports, starting with gastroscopies, so that data scientists can utilise gastroenterology data to develop better visualisations of gastroenterology data

The endoscopy datasets are created from building blocks but internally checked so that the complete report makes sense. Furthermore, patients with individual conditions that, for example require ongoing surveillance, will have further endoscopies in the dataset for that condition which is truer to real life

As in real-life, some of the endoscopies will also have pathology reports where specimens are taken. The pathology reports are also synthetic and created in a format that means that the report as a whole makes sense.

The methodology for the building of these synthetic datasets will be further explained when the documentation is fully developed.
